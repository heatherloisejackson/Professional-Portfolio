# Professional-Portfolio
A professional portfolio of my work relating to web development.


## Description

Here I used my efficiant HTML and CSS skills to put together my own professional portfolio. Though a difficult task, creating an interactive and responsive webpage is a great way to show efficiancy in front-facing Web Development using only HTML and CSS. The knowlege needed to build this page is exactly what clients and employers want to see, and by creating a page that is actually about me and my accomplishments, as well as information leading a potential client or employer to my portfolio of work, I've essentially doubled the value of this portfolio. By designing this page with my own creative direction, I was able to learn a multitude of new CSS styling skills that haven't been apart of the specific design of pages we have dealt with so far in class.
